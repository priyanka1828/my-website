My name is Priyanka. I often don’t use the surname Dumre—not out of rejection, but because it carries a special part of my journey that I still reflect on deeply. I was born in New Delhi, India, on 28 August 2006, and lived there peacefully for the first 10 years of my life. Everything I knew—my friends, my culture, my surroundings—felt familiar and safe.

In 2016, life brought a big change. My family moved to Nepal, and with that came a completely new world: a different language, culture, society, and even a new surname. Earlier, I used the name Sharma, but after coming to Nepal, I started being called Dumre. It was a shift that I hadn’t expected, and as a young girl, it made me feel a little lost.

Adapting to this new life wasn’t easy at first. We had to slowly distance ourselves from our Indian friends and relatives, which created a sense of emotional isolation. I began keeping my feelings to myself, wearing a smile even on days when I felt like crying. But even in those silent moments, there was always someone who truly understood me—my Kanha, my <a href="https://iskcondesiretree.com/page/who-is-krishna#:~:text=Krishna%20is%20the%20embodiment%20of,connected%20with%20the%20Atharva%2Dveda." target="_blank"><b>Krishna</b></a> Krishna. He became my constant companion, the one I could talk to without fear.

In Nepal, I made new friends, but my parents were often concerned that friendships might distract me from studies. So, I learned to balance both—valuing my friendships while focusing on my responsibilities. I also had dreams beyond academics, like singing or acting, but I always respected my parents' wishes and tried to give my best to my studies.

Later, during my time in Class 11, I faced some difficult experiences in friendship. Some bonds that I thought were strong faded away, and I felt a kind of pain I hadn't known before. But once again, Krishna was there. I’d cry at night and smile during the day—but He saw it all. And slowly, with His grace, I began to heal.

That pain led me to ask myself a beautiful question: "Krishna is always there for me… what am I doing for Him?" This thought made me more sincere in my spiritual path. I began reading the Shrimad Bhagavad Gita, where I learned about Krishna’s mercy and love. In 2020, we watched the Ramayan and Mahabharat, which deepened my connection with our scriptures and introduced me to Srila Prabhupada, the great acharya and founder of ISKCON. I started listening to spiritual lectures and found a kind of peace I had never experienced before.

Chanting the Hare Krishna Mahamantra brought me so much joy and clarity. I also encouraged my younger sister, Srishti, to join me on this path, and we started living more peacefully together. Still, I longed for satsang, for the association of devotees who could guide me and inspire me further.

And then came another beautiful blessing in my life—Rahul Vaishnav, my best friend and a Krishna devotee. Before meeting him, I used to believe that people valued others only when they were useful. But he showed me something different—that genuine connection and support can exist without conditions. He was the first person, after Kanha, to whom I could speak openly, without fear of being judged.

Rahul introduced me to the teachings of Lord Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, the golden avatar of Radha-Krishna’s divine love. I started chanting 16 rounds, listening to kirtans, cooking offerings for Krishna, wearing tilak, and living a more sattvic life. My love for "Nitai Gaur Hari Bol" grew, and with each passing day, my spiritual journey became more joyful.

Even though my parents didn’t always understand my devotion, I kept moving ahead with kindness and inner faith. Rahul’s encouragement helped me stay strong without ever stepping away from my family values. I quietly visited ISKCON temples, listened to Krishna katha, and shared everything I learned with him. Every moment on this path has been healing and empowering.

Today, I feel peaceful, joyful, and deeply grateful. No matter what challenges life may bring, I know that I am never alone. Kanha is always by my side, holding my hand, giving me strength, and sending beautiful souls like Rahul to guide me.

So, thank you, Krishna—for being my eternal friend, my guide, and my strength. And thank you, Rahul—for being the kind-hearted soul who helped me walk this path with even more faith and love.
